        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used to define the presentation of web pages written in HTML and XML. It enables web developers to control how web pages look, including aspects such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, across different devices and screen sizes.    </p>

    <h1>Key Features of CSS:
    </h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Selectors:</b> CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements on which styles are applied. Selectors can be based on element types (div, p, h1), classes (.classname), IDs (#idname), attributes, and more.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Properties and Values:</b> CSS properties define how HTML elements should be styled. Each property has one or more values that specify how the property should be applied. For example</li>
<br>

<br>
<img src="" alt="">
<li><b>Box Model:</b> Every element in CSS is treated as a rectangular box with content, padding, border, and margin areas. Understanding and manipulating these areas allows developers to control spacing and layout effectively.

</li>
<br>
<li><b>Responsive Design:</b> CSS supports responsive design principles, allowing developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. Media queries are commonly used to apply different styles based on factors like screen width.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Flexbox and Grid Layouts:</b>: CSS includes powerful layout modules like Flexbox and CSS Grid that simplify complex layouts and improve control over positioning and alignment of elements.</li>
<br>
<li><b>CSS Preprocessors:</b> These are extensions of CSS that add features like variables, nesting, and functions, which make stylesheets more maintainable and reusable. Examples include Sass and Less.</li>
<br>
<li><b>CSS Frameworks:</b> These are pre-written, standardized CSS files that provide a responsive grid system and commonly used components (e.g., buttons, forms). Popular frameworks include Bootstrap and Foundation.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Importance of CSS:
</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Separation of Concerns:</b>: CSS allows separation of content (HTML) and presentation (styling), making code cleaner and more maintainable.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Consistency:</b> CSS ensures consistent styling across a website, reinforcing branding and user experience.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Properly applied CSS can enhance accessibility by improving readability, contrast, and navigation.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Performance:</b> Efficient CSS coding practices can improve page load times and overall performance.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Advanced Concepts in CSS:</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>
    <h3><b>CSS Variables (Custom Properties):</b></h3>
    <p></p>
</li>
<ul type="">
    <li>CSS Variables allow you to define reusable values that can be used throughout your stylesheet. They enhance maintainability by centralizing commonly used values (like colors, spacing) and enable easier theming of websites.

<h3><b>CSS Transitions and Animations:</b></h3>
</li>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        CSS Transitions and Animations provide a way to add movement and interactivity to web pages without relying on JavaScript. Transitions control how property values change over time, while animations allow for more complex animations with keyframes.

</ul>
<br>
<li>
    <h3><b>CSS Flexbox:</b></h3>
</li>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to be aligned and distributed within a container, regardless of their size. It simplifies complex layouts and provides powerful tools for responsive design.
    </li>
    <br>

</ul>

<li>
    <h3><b>CSS Grid Layout:</b></h3>
</li>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        CSS Grid Layout introduces a two-dimensional grid system for laying out content. It allows precise control over column and row placement, making it ideal for creating complex, grid-based layouts.
    </li>
    <br>

</ul>
<li>
    <h3><b>Media Queries:</b></h3>
</li>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Media Queries enable developers to apply different styles based on characteristics of the device, such as screen width, orientation, or resolution. They are crucial for creating responsive designs that adapt gracefully to various devices.
